KNOWN AND COMMON ISSUES
-----------------------

Error:     
            when creating a custom command: "the name [...] does not exist in the namespace clr-namespace:VMSpc"
Solution: 
            close Visual Studio, run as admin, and build the project, which normally fixes the issue. This appears to be a bug in WPF with no known solution yet.
            see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15051121/the-name-does-not-exist-in-the-namespace-clr-namespace.
            this may be resolved in VS2019
